Learning the Elm language

## Tooling and dynamics of coding
I'm using [Visual Studio Code][editor] editor with the [`elm` plugin][plugin] by **Sascha Brink**. In it you can type inside a `.elm` file 
``` Elm
Html.program
```
and hit tab to be welcomed by a basic template (while typing look for the hint given for auto-completing, just below the cursor).


A little bit of tuning in
  - [x] **Model** type
  - [x] **Msg** type
  - [x] **update** function
  - [x] **view** function
  - [x] **init** call
and you can contemplate your own Elm web app (or page?). Of course that you can further tune the code customizing all those parts and the subscriptions function.
